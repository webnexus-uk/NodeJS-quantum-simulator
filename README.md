# NodeJS-quantum-simulator - Quantum Simulator for NodeJS

NodeJS-quantum-simulator is an experimental quantum computing simulator for the NodeJS.
This code was adapted from [dakk's qc64](https://github.com/dakk/qc64/)

## Features

-    Simulate operations of various quantum gates including Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z, Hadamard, CNOT, and SWAP on a two-qubit system.


## How it works

Starting from the initial state |00>, the simulator can apply various quantum gates to manipulate the state of the two-qubit system. This allows for the simulation of various quantum computing concepts!


## Gate Sequences and Outputs

The simulator supports various gate sequences, and the measurement results will vary based on the gate sequence used. Here are some examples:

### Example 1

**Gate Sequence**: x0,x1,y0,y1,z0,z1,h0,h1,cx,sw

**Measurement Results**:

| Quantum State | Measurement Count | Output |
|---------------|------------------|--------|
| 00            | 5                | QQQQQ  |
| 01            | 0                |        |
| 10            | 0                |        |
| 11            | 23               | QQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ |

### Example 2

**Gate Sequence**: h0,h1,h0,h1,h0,h1

**Measurement Results**:

| Quantum State | Measurement Count | Output |
|---------------|------------------|--------|
| 00            | 14               | QQQQQQQQQQQQQ |
| 01            | 0                |                |
| 10            | 0                |                |
| 11            | 14               | QQQQQQQQQQQQQ |
